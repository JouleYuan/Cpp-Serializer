# Cpp-Serializer

This is a simple C++ serialization and deserialization library, which support binary and XML serialization and deserialization. At the present, the library can serialize and deserialize the following types: arithmetic (see [std::is_arithmetic](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_arithmetic)), C++ string type (`std::string`), STL containers (`std::pair`, `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::set`, and `std::map`) and user-defined types (`struct` and `class`).
